## Get a Pet

### About this project
Get a Pet is a pet adoption application created to demonstrate my skills in developing a full-stack web application using the MERN stack. It connects people with pets and includes several features, such as:
- Authentication system: handles user authentication and authorization.
- Middlewares: manage specific criteria and logic for each back-end route, such as validation, authentication and image upload.
- Redux: used with services and slices to properly manage and handle API call states.
- MongoDB Atlas: used to store all user and post data in a cloud-based NoSQL database.
- Local storage: used to store all profile and pet images.

### Observations
This project was developed to demonstrate my skills in building a full-stack application inspired by a cause I believe is important.
