## Get a Pet

### About this project
Get a Pet is a pet adoption application created to demonstrate my skills in developing a full-stack web application using the MERN stack. It connects people with pets and includes several features, such as:
- Authentication system: handles user authentication and authorization.
- Middlewares: manage specific criteria and logic for each back-end route, such as validation, authentication and image upload.
- Redux: used with services and slices to properly manage and handle API call states.
- MongoDB Atlas: used to store all user and post data in a cloud-based NoSQL database.
- Local storage: used to store all profile and pet images.

### Observations
This project was developed to demonstrate my skills in building a full-stack application inspired by a cause I believe is important.

### Functionalities
- Sign in, sign up and sign out user.
- Update user profile information: username, phone number, password and profile photo.
- Delete user account.
- View the home feed with all available and adopted pets.
- View pet details, with the option to request or cancel a visit.
- Create, Update and Delete pets.
- My Pets feed: displays all of a user's pets, with options to conclude an adoption or cancel a visit.
- My Adoptions feed: displays all of a user's adoption requests, including the contact information of the pet owner and the option to cancel a visit.

### Getting Started
To run this application in development mode, first create an account on MongoDB Atlas and set up a database named getapet_database. Then, add your MongoDB username, password and JWT secret to the back-endâ€™s .env file.
